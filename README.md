Types of Load Testing
Smoke Testing:
Smoke tests are a type of load testing with minimal load, utilized to verify system functionality under minimal load conditions and to collect baseline performance metrics.
Typically, smoke testing involves running tests with a few Virtual Users (VUs); more than 5 VUs may be considered a mini-load test.
Tests should execute for a brief period, either through a low number of iterations or a duration ranging from seconds to a few minutes at most.
