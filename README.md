# Types of Load Testing

## Smoke Testing

- **Definition**: Smoke tests are a type of load testing characterized by minimal load. They serve to verify system functionality under minimal load conditions and establish baseline performance metrics.
- **Execution**: Typically, smoke testing involves running tests with a small number of Virtual Users (VUs). Using more than 5 VUs may transition the test into a mini-load test.
- **Duration**: Tests should execute for a brief period, either through a low number of iterations or a duration ranging from seconds to a few minutes at most.
